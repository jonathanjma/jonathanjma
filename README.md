  - [Happiness App](https://github.com/jonathanjma/HappinessApp), a full stack React + Flask powered social journaling web app where users can rate how they feel each day, view their happiness trends, and share them with their friends. Check it out [here](https://happinessapp.me)!
  - [Alpha CubeSat Ground Station](https://github.com/Alpha-CubeSat/Alpha-Cubesat-Ground-Python), the ground station software for Cornell SSDS's [Alpha CubeSat mission](http://alphacubesat.cornell.edu/). I am currently translating the backend from the Clojure functional programming language to the Python Flask framework and building the frontend using React.
